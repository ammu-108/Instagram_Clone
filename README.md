# Getting Started with Create Instagram Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Instagram Clone

Instagram Clone is a web application that replicates the core features of Instagram. It's built using React for the frontend.

## Features

- **Side Navigation Buttons:** Intuitive side navigation buttons for easy access to different sections of the application.
- **Timeline:** A visually appealing timeline where users can scroll through and view posts.
- **Interactive Like Button:** Users can interact with posts by liking them.
- **Suggestion Bar:** A suggestion bar that provides personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- yarn or npm (Node Package Manager)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


### `npm run build` fails to minify
